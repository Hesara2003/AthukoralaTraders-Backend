# Customer Profile & Navigation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Button Still Showing After Login ✅
**Root Cause:** Product pages (`/products` and `/products/:id`) were using `PublicLayout` which always shows the login button, regardless of authentication status.

**Solution:** Updated both `ProductPage.jsx` and `ProductDetail.jsx` to conditionally use:
- `CustomerLayout` when user is authenticated (shows profile with dropdown)
- `PublicLayout` when user is not authenticated (shows login button)

### 2. Login Button Not Working ✅
**Root Cause:** The login button in `PublicLayout` was properly configured and working. The issue was that logged-in users were still seeing the PublicLayout instead of CustomerLayout.

**Solution:** With the conditional layout fix above, logged-in users now see the `CustomerLayout` with the profile dropdown instead of the login button.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/pages/Customer/ProductPage.jsx`**
   - Added `CustomerLayout` import
   - Added conditional layout selection: `const Layout = user ? CustomerLayout : PublicLayout;`
   - Removed unused `logout` import and `handleLogout` function
   - Cleaned up unused icon imports (`User`, `LogOut`)

2. **`src/pages/Customer/ProductDetail.jsx`**
   - Added `CustomerLayout` import
   - Added conditional layout selection: `const Layout = user ? CustomerLayout : PublicLayout;`
   - Updated all layout references (loading, error, and main return)
   - Removed unused `logout` import and `handleLogout` function
   - Cleaned up unused icon imports (`User`, `LogOut`)

### Behavior Changes:

#### For Logged-Out Users (Guest):
- **Route:** `/products` → Uses `PublicLayout`
- **Navigation:** Shows login button
- **Hero Section:** Generic welcome message
- **After Login:** Redirects to `/products` (now with CustomerLayout)

#### For Logged-In Users (Customers):
- **Route:** `/products` → Uses `CustomerLayout`
- **Navigation:** Shows profile dropdown with:
  - Profile avatar (Google image or initials)
  - Full name and email
  - Online status indicator
  - Google authentication badge (if applicable)
  - Quick action menu (Profile, Orders, Wishlist, Settings)
  - Logout option
- **Hero Section:** Personalized "Welcome back, [Name]!" message

## User Flow Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Guest User
1. Visit `/products` → Should see PublicLayout with login button
2. Click login button → Should navigate to `/login`
3. Login successfully → Should redirect back to `/products` with CustomerLayout

### Test Scenario 2: Logged-In User
1. Visit `/products` → Should see CustomerLayout with profile dropdown
2. Profile shows correct name, email, and avatar
3. Hero section shows personalized welcome message
4. No login button visible

### Test Scenario 3: Logout Process
1. Click profile dropdown
2. Click "Sign Out"
3. Should redirect to login page
4. Visit `/products` again → Should see PublicLayout with login button

## Authentication State Management

The conditional layout system works with the existing `AuthContext`:
- `user` object presence determines layout choice
- All user data (name, email, profile image, Google auth status) flows through
- Layout switches automatically on login/logout state changes

## Responsive Design

Both layouts maintain responsive behavior:
- **Mobile:** Profile dropdown adapts with touch-friendly interface
- **Tablet/Desktop:** Full profile information displayed
- **Navigation:** Consistent across all screen sizes

This fix ensures a seamless user experience where the interface appropriately reflects the user's authentication status.
